This repository contains the assets and codes for implementing a Firebase-powered website database called BAKA 360.

## Introduction
According to the PSA Special release on the preliminary result of the 4th Quarter 2022 Livestock and Poultry Volume of Production and Inventory of Western Visayas, cattle production decreased by -3.02%. Albay Rep. Salceda elaborated in his statement that the main issues of the livestock sector are limited economies of scale due to many small producers, high feed costs, and disjointed government support (Cervantes, 2022). Hence, BAKA 360 aims to develop and integrate a farm-to-market cattle management system to assist farm animal caretakers in managing their cattle to increase their operations' efficiency and the quality and quantity of their produce.

## Mockup
Shown below is the mockup of the said website database.
