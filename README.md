This repository contains the assets and codes for implementing a Firebase-powered website database called BAKA 360.

## Introduction
Based on the PSA Special Release on the preliminary result of the 4th Quarter 2022 Livestock and Poultry Volume of Production and Inventory of Western Visayas, cattle production decreased by -3.02%. The Albay Rep. Salceda elaborated in his statement that the main issues of the livestock sector are limited economies of scale due to many small producers, high feed costs, and disjointed government support (Cervantes, 2022). Hence, BAKA 360 aims to develop and integrate a farm-to-market cattle management system to assist farm animal caretakers in managing their cattle to increase their operations' efficiency and the quality and quantity of their produce.

## Features
Due to the limited time available for the creation of this website database, members will only implement selected features from the proposal - with the consideration of applying information systems concepts. It has been decided that the following features on this website will include:

* Homepage - This page provides users an overview on site announcements, feautures, and offers that could be beneficial for their cattle management
* News- related livestock and new trends - This feature will give some updates or news about cattle management new approaches.
* Inventory - Ensures the total number of stocks of cattle products such as beef, milk and breeding of cattle.
* Marketing - It allows users to determine if the cattle products are marketable based on its status and health records.

## Mockup
Shown below is a mockup of the said website database.
